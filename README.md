Introduction

Welcome to the repository for my basic sample Angular application. This project has been crafted to showcase my software development abilities, particularly my proficiency with Angular, a powerful and widely-used front-end framework. Below, you'll find an overview of the application's features, setup instructions, and a brief explanation of the code structure.
Project Overview:
This application demonstrates several key aspects of Angular development, including:
1.	Component-Based Architecture: The application is built using Angular's component-based architecture, promoting modularity and reusability of code.
2.	Data Binding: It showcases two-way data binding, allowing for seamless interaction between the UI and the underlying data model.
3.	Routing and Navigation: The app includes a simple yet effective routing mechanism, demonstrating navigation between different views.
4.	Services and Dependency Injection: It utilizes Angular services and dependency injection to manage and share data across components efficiently.
5.	Form Handling: The project includes examples of template-driven and reactive forms, highlighting form validation and user input handling.
6.	HTTP Client: The application makes use of Angular's HTTP client module to interact with a mock backend API, demonstrating how to handle asynchronous data fetching.
Setup Instructions:
To run this project locally, please follow these steps:
1.	Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone URL
cd your-repo
2.	Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, run:
bash
Copy code
npm install
3.	Run the Application: Start the development server with:
bash
Copy code
ng serve

Navigate to http://localhost:4200 in your web browser to see the application in action.

Code Structure:
The application follows a standard Angular project structure. Here’s a brief overview:

>	src/app: Contains the main application code.

>	components: Houses the individual components, each with its own HTML, CSS, and TypeScript files.

>	services: Contains the services used for data handling and business logic.

>	models: Includes TypeScript interfaces and models used throughout the application.

>	app-routing.module.ts: Defines the application's routing configuration.

>	app.module.ts: The main application module where components, services, and other modules are declared and imported.

Features and Functionality
•	User Interface: A clean and responsive UI built with Angular's templating and styling capabilities.
•	Navigation: Seamless routing between different views using Angular Router.
•	Data Management: Efficient data handling with Angular services and HTTP client for API interactions.
•	Form Handling: Demonstrates both template-driven and reactive forms with validation.

Conclusion
This sample application is a reflection of my abilities in developing robust and maintainable front-end applications using Angular. It highlights my understanding of key Angular concepts and best practices. If you have any questions or need further details, please feel free to contact me.
Thank you for reviewing my work!
